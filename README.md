# math-bcmb3888

Github repository for 2022 MATH3888 Capstone Stream 2.

## Contents

`stp` folder contains source code for the project. `mega` and `slim` are almost identical folders, with the main difference being using the `slim_list.csv` and the `mega_list.csv` files containing NAFLD-related proteins. `data` contains the essential proteins list `essential.csv` sourced from YeastMine and the yeast network `yeast.txt` sourced from STRING. `human_to_yeast` converts list of human proteins associated with NAFLD to their yeast homologs through the YeastMine API. `stp.py` contains functions to convert between NetworkX graph instances and `.stp` files. 

### Source: Essential Proteins
1. Go to [YeastMine](https://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/yeastmine/begin.do)
2. Go to Phenotypes (in the grey middle bar); then click on "Phenotypes --> Genes"; then choose "=" "inviable".

### Source: Yeast Network
1.  Go to [STRING](https://string-db.org/)
2. Go to "download"; -- enter saccharomyces cerevisiae into the dropdown menu "organism name"
3. Download the file `4932.protein.links.v11.5.txt.gz`
4. Extract, delete the header and rename to `yeast.txt`

## Requirements

Required packages can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements`.

## Downloading [SCIP-Jack](https://scipjack.zib.de/) to solve Steiner Tree Problem
Trying to download and compile SCIP-Jack on my Windows machine was hellish. Download WSL/use a VM and use the Linux + make download options.

### Steps:
1. Download the SCIP optimization suite: https://scipopt.org/index.php#download
2. (Linux only) Navigate to directory containing download and run the following commands to build SCIP, replacing x.y.z with the relevant version number:
```{bash}
tar xvzf scipoptsuite-x.y.z.tgz              # unpack the tarball
cd scipoptsuite-x.y.z.tgz                    # change into the directory
make                                         # start compiling SCIP
make test                                    # (recommended) check your SCIP installation
```
3. (Linux only) Navigate to `applications/STP` folder and run `make` to build SCIP-Jack

### Execution:
1. Load graph into filename.stp where .stp is a file extension used by SCIP-Jack to represent the STP and input. For more information check http://steinlib.zib.de/format.php.
2. Create a file called 'write.set' in folder /applications/STP/settings with content `stp/logfile = "use_probname"`
3. Run the command `bin/stp -f filename.stp -s settings/write.set`. This will create a .stplog file that contains the solution to the STP.

stp.py was used to convert between NetworkX instances of graphs to the .stp form required for SCIP-Jack. For the purposes of reproducability, the SCIPOpt version downloaded was 8.0.2.
