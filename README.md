## Requirements

Required packages can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements`.

## Downloading [SCIP-Jack](https://scipjack.zib.de/) to solve Steiner Tree Problem
Trying to download and compile SCIP-Jack on my Windows machine was hellish. Download WSL/use a VM and use the Linux + make download options.

### Steps:
1. Download the SCIP optimization suite: https://scipopt.org/index.php#download
2. (Linux only) Navigate to directory containing download and run the following commands to build SCIP, replacing x.y.z with the relevant version number:
```{bash}
tar xvzf scipoptsuite-x.y.z.tgz              # unpack the tarball
cd scipoptsuite-x.y.z.tgz                    # change into the directory
make                                         # start compiling SCIP
make test                                    # (recommended) check your SCIP installation
```
3. (Linux only) Navigate to `applications/STP` folder and run `make` to build SCIP-Jack

### Execution:
1. Load graph into filename.stp where .stp is a file extension used by SCIP-Jack to represent the STP and input. For more information check http://steinlib.zib.de/format.php.
2. Create a file called 'write.set' in folder /applications/STP/settings with content `stp/logfile = "use_probname"`
3. Run the command `bin/stp -f filename.stp -s settings/write.set`. This will create a .stplog file that contains the solution to the STP.

stp.py was used to convert between NetworkX instances of graphs to the .stp form required for SCIP-Jack. For the purposes of reproducability, the SCIPOpt version downloaded was 8.0.2.
